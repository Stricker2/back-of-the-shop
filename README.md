## Description
Build the back-end of an ecommerce site using the Express.js API and configuring it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database filled with tables containing different categories and their products.

## Steps Taken
* Define the four models to be used and the columns that will be held within each model's mySQL table.

* Write the association methods by which the models will be able to interact with each other.

* Write the routes for each model. Routes include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE so that we can perform CRUD operations. 

* Seed the existing data to the database by running "npm run seed".

* Before starting the server, ensure that the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

* Use a testing platform (such as Insomnia) to ensure that all routes and associations are working.

## Walkthrough Video

Video Notes: Video length is 04:52. First 4 minutes is creating the database in mySQL, selecting the database to be used in mySQL, seeding the data to the database, and finally, showing the back-end being tested in Insomnia. If you wish to see the dependencies, sequelize connections and sync, please skip to 04:13.
